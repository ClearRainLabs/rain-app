Right now the frontend is integrate with 3box storage. I want to move away from 3box for the short term. We'll still use them to sign in, but all data will be stored in a central database. A central database will allow us to be more agile at early stages.

**Start developing**

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ClearRainLabs/rain-app.git
cd micro-rain/
yarn install
yarn dev
```
